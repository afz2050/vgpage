    <h1>Cost of Living and Expenditure in Malaysia</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">By Afras Ashraf (33803218)</p>

    <p>Over the past decade, Malaysians have faced steadily increasing living costs. From basic groceries to housing and transport, price changes affect every household — but not all regions or income groups experience these changes equally.</p>

    <p>This visualisation explores how prices, inflation patterns, and household affordability differ across Malaysia</p>

    <!-- Section 1 -->
    <section>
      <div>
        <h2>Price Changes Across Categories</h2>
        <p>Not all goods and services have risen in price at the same rate.</p>
        <p>You can observe that Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverages consistently remain the largest contributor to inflation, followed by Housing, Utilities, and Transport.</p>

        <h2>Inflation Trends Over Time</h2>
        <p>The line chart here shows Malaysia's CPI trend over time, representing the overall change in the cost of living</p>

        <h2>Urban vs Rural Differences</h2>
        <p>The cost of living gap between urban and rural areas is clearly visible in the CPI data.</p>

            <p>The specific groups that have the most inflation can be seen here.</p>
            <p>While rural areas tend to have lower housing and service costs, urban residents face higher prices for transport, rent, and food.</p>

    <section>
      <div>
        <h2>Household Income</h2>
        <p>States such as Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, and Putrajaya record the highest household incomes, reflecting their more urbanised economies and higher-paying industries.</p>
        <p>In contrast, Kelantan, Perlis, and Sabah have significantly lower average incomes, highlighting the continued urban-rural income gap across the country.</p>

    <section>
      <div>
        <h2>Household Expenditure</h2>
        <p>Spending patterns tend to follow income levels — households in urban states such as Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, and Penang spend considerably more per month, largely due to higher housing, transport, and food costs.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, rural and northern states such as Kelantan, Perlis, and Terengganu have lower overall expenditures, reflecting both lower living costs and lower disposable incomes.</p>
