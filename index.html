    <h1>Cost of Living and Expenditure in Malaysia</h1>
    <p>Over the past decade, Malaysians have faced steadily increasing living costs.
From basic groceries to housing and transport, price changes affect every household â€” but not all regions or income groups experience these changes equally.</p>
    <p>This visualisation explores how prices, inflation patterns, and household affordability differ across Malaysia using data from the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM).</p>

    <h2>Price Changes Across Categories</h2>
    <p>Not all goods and services have risen in price at the same rate.</p>
    <p>This grouped bar chart shows how CPI values for major item groups (such as Food, Housing, and Transport) have changed over recent years.</p>

    <p>You can observe that Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverages consistently remain the largest contributor to inflation, followed by Housing, Utilities, and Transport.</p>
